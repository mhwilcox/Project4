[ RUN      ] ConvertWords.AntToArt

start of solution:  

This is what s1 needs to turn into: art
s1: ant s2: art
s1: ant and s2: art share a char at: 2

    char doesn't match at: 1 pushing to adjChar. 
s1: ant and s2: art share a char at: 0

char that is being adjusted: 1
wtemp = aat	wtemp = abt	wtemp = act	wtemp = adt	wtemp = aet	wtemp = aft	wtemp = agt	wtemp = aht	wtemp = ait	wtemp = ajt	wtemp = akt	wtemp = alt	wtemp = amt	wtemp = ant	wtemp = aot	wtemp = apt	wtemp = aqt	wtemp = art	
THIS IS CORRECT!!!! wtemp: art
